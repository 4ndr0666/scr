# Web Apps

---

The following is a collection of additional considerations, settings and tips/tricks in order to optimize the "WebApps" pkg in the **AUR**.

**Guidelines**:

   - Start browser with these flags: `--disable-extensions --start-maximized --disable-gpu --disable-infobars --kiosk`.

   - Ensure that `Open link in tabs instead of new windows` is **NOT** selected.

   - Ensure Digital Rights Management **`DRM`** is selected in settings. Search "**`DRM`**" if you cant find it.

   - Right click on the the bookmark bar and select `never show`.

   - Close the bar about previous tabs if it exists to remove the nav bar.

## Specific Apps

**Discord**:

   - Launch the app (*example*:**Discord**) and go into a room you own or that no one else is in. Start the audio chat and select the mic. Check the `Remember for all microphones` option in the box and click `allow`.

   - Click `screen share` and allow it.
