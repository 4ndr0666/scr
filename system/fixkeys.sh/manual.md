## Introduction

This Linux script is designed to provide comprehensive control and fix functionalities for managing repositories and keyrings. It is written in Python and consists of three main modules: `main.py`, `repo_manager.py`, and `keyring_manager.py`. The script allows you to add, remove, and update repositories, as well as add, remove, and update keyrings.

## Installation

   python main.py
   ```

3. The script will execute the predefined functions for managing repositories and keyrings. You can modify the script to add or remove specific functionalities as per your requirements.

## Functionality

- `add_repo(repo_url)`: Adds a repository to the system.

- `remove_repo(repo_url)`: Removes a repository from the system.

- `update_repo(repo_url)`: Updates a repository in the system.

- `adjust_signature_levels()`: Adjusts the signature levels in the `pacman.conf` file.

### Keyring Management

The `KeyringManager` class in `keyring_manager.py` provides the following functions for keyring management:

- `add_keyring(keyring_name)`: Adds a keyring to the system.

- `remove_keyring(keyring_name)`: Removes a keyring from the system.

- `update_keyring(keyring_name)`: Updates a keyring in the system.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of how you can use the script to manage repositories and keyrings:

```python
from repo_manager import RepoManager
from keyring_manager import KeyringManager

repo_manager = RepoManager()
keyring_manager = KeyringManager()

# Add a repository
repo_manager.add_repo("repo_url")

# Remove a repository
repo_manager.remove_repo("repo_url")

# Update a repository
repo_manager.update_repo("repo_url")

# Adjust signature levels
repo_manager.adjust_signature_levels()

# Add a keyring
keyring_manager.add_keyring("keyring_name")

# Remove a keyring
keyring_manager.remove_keyring("keyring_name")

# Update a keyring
keyring_manager.update_keyring("keyring_name")
```
