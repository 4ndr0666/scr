Linux Permissions Help
----------------------

Permissions in Linux are managed through a system of ownership and predefined permissions associated with objects like files and directories. The permissions system is divided into three distinct scopes: Owner, Group, and Others.

Understanding Permissions:
Permissions are represented as a three-digit number, where each digit corresponds to the permissions for the Owner, Group, and Others respectively.

Each scope can have the following permissions:
- Read (r): Permission to read the contents.
- Write (w): Permission to modify or delete.
- Execute (x): Permission to execute.

Numerically, these permissions are represented as follows:
- Read: 4
- Write: 2
- Execute: 1

Common Permission Modes:
- chmod 751: +rwx for owner, +rx for group, +x for others
- chmod 755: +rwx for owner, +rwx for group, +rx for others
- chmod 744: +wx for owner, no permissions for group, +r for others
- ... and so on.

Menu Options Explained:
1. Change Ownership (Chown): Changes the ownership of the specified directory recursively.
2. Compare Permissions: Checks system files and compares their current permissions against the package defaults.
3. Get ACL (Access Control List): Displays the ACL for the specified directory.
4. Help on Permissions: Displays this help documentation.
5. Reset Permissions to Defaults: Resets permissions on certain system directories to sensible defaults.
6. Exit: Exits the script.

Usage:
1. Launch the script.
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to select an option from the menu.
3. For Chown and Get ACL options, you may be prompted to enter a directory path if not provided as an argument when launching the script.

Note:
- It's advisable to have a backup before making changes to permissions, especially on system directories.
- Incorrect permissions can lead to system instability or security risks.
