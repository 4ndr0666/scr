### Compile Markdown Files to PDF

```python
schedule_pdf_compile(600)  # Schedule to run in 600 seconds (10 minutes)
```

### Compress Directory

```python
compressed_archive_path = process_and_compress(os.path.join(SANDBOX_PATH, "data", "Final"))
if compressed_archive_path:
    logging.info(f"Archive created at: {compressed_archive_path}")
else:
    logging.error("Compression failed.")
```
