"1. Simulated Depth of Field Pull

> **Prompt:** From a high-resolution studio portrait of the model, generate a video where the camera smoothly racks focus sequentially from the model’s eyes to lips and finally the background, simulating professional aperture adjustment during a beauty shoot. The camera movement should be subtle and fluid to emphasize depth shifts.
> **Lighting:** Broncolor studio strobes with softboxes creating diffused, soft shadows.
> **Lighting Direction:** Key light positioned at 45° camera right, fill light at 135° camera left.
> **Shadow Quality:** Soft, gradual shadow edges.
> **Lens:** 85mm f/1.4 prime lens, aperture wide open for shallow depth of field effect.
> **Camera Move:** Smooth rack focus with minimal physical camera movement; static tripod mount.
> **Environment:** Controlled studio environment with neutral seamless gray backdrop.
> **Background Complexity:** Minimalist, smooth gradient gray.
"
"2. Lighting Shift Exploration

> **Prompt:** Animate this editorial portrait by smoothly transitioning the lighting from Rembrandt style (45° side key light creating characteristic triangular cheek shadow) to butterfly lighting (symmetrical, top-front key with soft shadows under the nose). Simulate a vertical softbox movement from side to top center, visibly altering shadow contours on the model’s face as in a professional lighting test.
> **Lighting:** 1x 120cm rectangular softbox as key light, 1x large white bounce reflector as fill.
> **Lighting Direction:** Key light shifts from camera left side (45° elevation) to directly overhead (90° elevation).
> **Shadow Quality:** Soft, feathered shadows with smooth transitions.
> **Lens:** 85mm f/1.8, fixed focus.
> **Camera Move:** Locked tripod frame, no movement.
> **Environment:** Studio setting with seamless white backdrop.
> **Background Complexity:** Minimal, uniform white.
"
"3. Studio-to-Location Match Cut

> **Prompt:** Generate a video transforming the background and ambient lighting from a high-key studio setup with artificial strobes to warm, natural window light streaming in from camera left. Maintain the model’s pose and expression constant throughout. Frame remains constant, highlighting gradual light temperature and intensity shift to emulate a location scout lighting test.
> **Lighting:** High-key studio strobes with softboxes transitioning to natural daylight simulation.
> **Lighting Direction:** Studio key light at 45° camera right transitioning to natural window light at 45° camera left.
> **Shadow Quality:** Soft to moderate contrast shadows.
> **Lens:** 50mm f/1.8 prime lens, constant framing.
> **Camera Move:** Static tripod frame.
> **Environment:** Studio interior transitioning to near-window location setting.
> **Background Complexity:** Clean, minimalistic.
"
"4. Multi-Pose Morph Sequence

> **Prompt:** Animate a smooth interpolation sequence from a single fashion image where the model transitions through three classic poses: contrapposto stance, profile with gaze over shoulder, and frontal relaxed pose. Simulate photographer direction cues with subtle pauses between poses.
> **Lighting:** Profoto beauty dish as key, with 2x 60cm strip softboxes as rim lights from camera left and right.
> **Lighting Direction:** Key light at 30° camera front right, rim lights at 90° sides.
> **Shadow Quality:** Moderate soft shadows with crisp rim highlights.
> **Lens:** 85mm f/2.0 prime lens, shallow depth of field.
> **Camera Move:** Fixed tripod with no movement.
> **Environment:** Studio with seamless mid-gray backdrop.
> **Background Complexity:** Minimal and uniform.
"
"5. Cinematic Camera Move (Arc or Dolly)

> **Prompt:** From a full-body portrait image, animate a smooth, slow camera arc moving horizontally from camera left to right around the model at a radius of approximately 3 meters, mimicking behind-the-scenes video shot on a gimbal stabilizer.
> **Lighting:** Edge-lit setup with a 1.2m octabox key light camera right and low-intensity fill light camera left.
> **Lighting Direction:** Key light positioned at 90° camera right, fill light at 120° camera left, low intensity.
> **Shadow Quality:** Hard shadows with soft fill to retain detail.
> **Lens:** 35mm f/2.8 wide-angle prime lens.
> **Camera Move:** Horizontal arc/dolly move, steady speed, stabilized gimbal simulation.
> **Environment:** Studio with neutral white seamless backdrop.
> **Background Complexity:** Minimalist, clean.
"
"6. On-Set Environmental Effects

> **Prompt:** Animate subtle environmental effects on a fashion portrait: simulate gentle wind blowing through the model’s hair and flowing fabric using controlled directional air movement. Add a light haze effect mimicking in-studio haze machine diffusion.
> **Lighting:** Directional backlight with a 90cm Fresnel spotlight from camera rear left to create silhouette highlights.
> **Lighting Direction:** Backlight at 135° camera left, moderate intensity.
> **Shadow Quality:** Hard shadows with crisp edges from backlight.
> **Lens:** 85mm f/1.8 prime lens.
> **Camera Move:** Static tripod mount.
> **Environment:** Studio environment with haze diffusion.
> **Background Complexity:** Dark, minimal to emphasize silhouette and haze.
"
"7. Flash-to-Continuous Lighting Comparison

> **Prompt:** Animate a seamless transition between two lighting setups: a crisp, flash-lit portrait with hard shadows and a soft continuous light mood with gentle shadow gradations. Model reacts subtly to light changes with slight head tilt and expression change.
> **Lighting:** Flash with 60cm beauty dish key light transitioning to continuous LED panel with soft diffusion.
> **Lighting Direction:** Key light from 45° camera right throughout transition.
> **Shadow Quality:** Hard to soft gradient shadow transition.
> **Lens:** 85mm f/1.4 prime lens.
> **Camera Move:** Slight slow push-in dolly.
> **Environment:** Studio setting with neutral backdrop.
> **Background Complexity:** Minimal.
"
"8. Portfolio B-Roll Movement

> **Prompt:** Convert a high-resolution model portrait into a short, seamless looping B-roll featuring subtle head tilt, micro-expression shifts, and simulated handheld camera sway for organic editorial feel.
> **Lighting:** Mixed natural window light from camera left combined with soft fill from bounce reflector camera right.
> **Lighting Direction:** Natural fill balance, soft shadows.
> **Shadow Quality:** Soft shadows with natural falloff.
> **Lens:** 85mm f/1.8 prime lens.
> **Camera Move:** Simulated handheld, slight, natural sway.
> **Environment:** Indoor studio with large window.
> **Background Complexity:** Simple, unobtrusive.
"
"9. Refined Skin/Texture Detail

> **Prompt:** Animate a slow, deliberate camera glide over a beauty close-up focusing on the model’s face, revealing micro-details such as skin texture, makeup application, and jewelry sparkle, replicating macro lens video techniques.
> **Lighting:** Ring light centered on face providing even, soft illumination with minimal shadows.
> **Lighting Direction:** Frontal ring light, diffuse.
> **Shadow Quality:** Minimal shadows, very soft.
> **Lens:** 100mm macro lens equivalent, shallow depth of field.
> **Camera Move:** Slow lateral glide and slight zoom-in.
> **Environment:** Studio with neutral seamless backdrop.
> **Background Complexity:** Minimal.
"
"10. Editorial Composite Expansion

> **Prompt:** Extend a studio portrait by animating a slow zoom-out to reveal additional set elements including props and assistants, simulating a photographer pulling back for a wide editorial shot.
> **Lighting:** Balanced three-point lighting: key (softbox, 45° camera right), fill (bounce reflector camera left), and backlight (hair light from rear center).
> **Lighting Direction:** Classic three-point setup.
> **Shadow Quality:** Soft with controlled highlights.
> **Lens:** 50mm f/2.0 standard prime.
> **Camera Move:** Slow zoom-out on tripod mount.
> **Environment:** Studio set with visible set elements.
> **Background Complexity:** Moderate, contextual.
