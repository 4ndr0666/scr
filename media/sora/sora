"Full-Speed Run — Patterned Bikini, Sunlit Shoreline

{[tracking shot, push in]
I need you to generate a high-detail, Roger Deakins-inspired scene of an adult female athlete in a patterned bikini top and high-waisted black bottoms running directly toward the camera at full speed along a sunlit shoreline.
Action: The subject is always in motion—never standing still or pausing—her arms and legs driving her forward with intensity. Hair and clothing fly with every stride; she never adjusts her hair or stops.
Camera: The lens (85 mm f/2.0, shallow DoF) tracks perfectly with her face and upper body, pushing in so that her determined, focused expression fills most of the frame as she runs.
Lighting: Hard natural sunlight at 30° camera-left (5600 K); silver bounce fill at 45° right for crisp facial highlights.
Shadows: Strong side shadow, deep mid-tones, and clear edge separation.
Environment: Open shoreline, ocean and surf blurred behind—no standing, no hair adjusting, no relaxation, no leisure—just athletic effort.
Micro-Detail: Sunlight sparkles on skin, sweat, and rippling fabric at each stride; dynamic muscle and hair movement.
Background: No visible beachgoers or distractions—subject is alone in motion.
Mood: Pure athletic intensity and motion, never leisure or idleness.
Loop: Optionally freeze final frame for seamless replay.
Note: cinematic references must be interpreted within Sora’s current technical capabilities (1080 p / 24 fps default unless overridden).

"Macro Micro-Detail — Fabric & Skin, Deakins Lighting

{[push in, macro, static shot]
I need you to enhance this photo with precision cinematic lighting inspired by Roger Deakins. Illuminate the subject to highlight micro-details and nuanced textures in both skin and fabric. Use hard natural sunlight angled at 30° camera-left for crisp highlights and gentle shadows, complemented by a subtle silver bounce at 45° right to softly lift midtones.
Shadows: Rich, sculpted with clear edge separation and natural falloff.
Lens: 100mm macro at f/2.8, shallow depth for extreme clarity.
Camera: Begin static, then push in slightly to accentuate detail, keeping the composition clean and focused.
Micro-Detail: Emphasize fabric weave, pores, and light interplay on skin.
Environment: Neutral, softly blurred.
Note: Cinematic references must be interpreted within each platform’s current capabilities.

"Full-Speed Run — Chest-Level, Ocean Blur

{[push in, tracking shot]
I need you to generate a high-detail, Roger Deakins-inspired scene of an adult female athlete running directly toward the camera along a sunlit shoreline. The camera starts at chest height, 1 meter from the subject, and tracks smoothly backward while pushing in so her face and upper body dominate the frame, keeping micro-details—skin texture, sunlight glint on moving fabric, individual hair strands—crisply in focus.
Lighting: Natural hard sunlight at 30° camera-left (5600 K), emphasizing skin highlights and the movement of fabric; subtle silver bounce at 45° right for soft fill.
Shadows: High contrast, with sculpted mid-tones and edge separation.
Lens: 85 mm f/2.0 prime, shallow depth of field for cinematic focus fall-off.
Environment & Background: Open shoreline, ocean and gentle surf blurred behind, with no visible beachgoers.
Mood: Focused athletic determination; no leisure or relaxation.
Action: Subject’s expression is intense and driven as she runs; hair and clothing respond dynamically to her motion and sunlight.
Micro-Detail: Capture sunlight on damp skin, fabric stretch, and hair movement at every stride.
Loop: Optionally freeze last frame 0.5 s for seamless replay.
Note: cinematic references must be interpreted within Sora’s current technical capabilities (1080 p / 24 fps default unless overridden).

"Sprint Toward Camera — Outdoor Track, Bokeh

{[push in, tracking shot]
I need you to film an adult protagonist sprinting toward camera in a single 4-second take. The camera starts 1 m in front of chest height, travels backward 0.7 m while pushing in so the face fills 70 % of frame at cut-point.
Camera / Lens: 85 mm f/2.0 prime—intimate close-up aesthetic inspired by Roger Deakins; shallow depth-of-field to reveal sweat beads and fabric weave.
Lighting: Golden-hour hard key positioned 35 ° camera-left, 5600 K; 2 × 1 m silver bounce 35 ° right for fill.
Shadows: Crisp highlights, gentle lifted mids; light skims across skin creating micro-detail sparkle.
Environment & Background: Open outdoor track rendered with very shallow DoF; background softly blurred to neutral bokeh.
Stabilisation: Gimbal simulation with breathing-level micro-sway; auto-focus locked on eyes.
Loop: Freeze final frame 0.5 s for seamless replay.
Post: Subtle 35 mm-grain overlay (235 ISO equivalent) for natural texture.
Note: cinematic references must be interpreted within Sora’s current technical capabilities (1080 p / 24 fps default unless overridden).
