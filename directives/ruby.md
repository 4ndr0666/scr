Automate the entire process using Ruby. Create comprehensive methods from the logic within each step. Ensure methods are encapsulated and reused appropriately to avoid redundancy. Use a central main method call method in a menu loop. Ensure the script is idempotent and handles edge cases robustly. Include user confirmations before executing critical actions using CLI prompts. Follow these guidelines:
