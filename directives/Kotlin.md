Automate the entire process using Kotlin. Create comprehensive functions from the logic within each step. Ensure functions are encapsulated and reused appropriately to avoid redundancy. Use a central main function call method in a menu loop. Ensure the script is idempotent and handles edge cases robustly. Include user confirmations before executing critical actions using CLI prompts. Follow these guidelines:
