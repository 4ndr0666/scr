Automate the entire process using JavaScript. Create comprehensive functions from the logic within each step. Ensure functions are encapsulated and reused appropriately to avoid redundancy. Use a central main function call method in a menu loop. Ensure the script is idempotent and handles edge cases robustly. Include user confirmations before executing critical actions using CLI prompts. Follow these guidelines:

File Layout

    Comment with LICENSE and possibly short explanation of file/tool.
    Imports
    Constants
    Function declarations:
        Include variable names.
        Group/order in logical manner.
    main

JavaScript Features

    Follow JavaScript (ES6) guidelines.
    Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
    Use modules for code organization.
    Group related functions together.
    Use proper error messages.

Functions

    Define functions with function keyword or arrow functions.
    Encapsulate logic within functions.
    Use meaningful variable names.
    Document functions with comments.

Handling Errors

    Use try/catch for error handling.
    Ensure the script is idempotent and handles edge cases robustly.
    Use console.error for error messages.
