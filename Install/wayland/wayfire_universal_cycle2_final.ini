# NOTE: The [core] section has been updated to include synergy plugins for your selected commands.
# This script merges synergy requirements (e.g., 'grid' plugin for 'snap' rules) automatically.
# You can remove or reorder plugins in 'plugins = ...' if needed.
# Always review these changes manually and confirm synergy with your existing setup.
