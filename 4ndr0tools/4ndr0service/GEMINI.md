# GEMINI.md

## Requirements

- **All files must be explicitly cleaned of any merge artifacts before any commit or pull request merge.**
- **Use the utility: `0-tests/merge-clean.sh <file ...>` to ensure no `<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<GEMINI_`, `=========================`, or `>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Main` blocks remain.**

  ```bash
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -e
  for f in $(git diff --cached --name-only); do
      [ -f "$f" ] && 0-tests/merge-clean.sh "$f"
  done
  git add .
  ```
  >**Merge & Review Protocol:**
  >
  >1. Attach coverage delta (`pytest-cov` or respective language output).
  >2. Run: codex-merge-clean.sh $(git diff --name-only main..HEAD)
  >3. If merge artifacts remain, reject PR and clean the conflicts.

- Run this tool after your merges, and before lint, test, or commit stages.
- Never use placeholders, half-measures, or omitted code lines.
- Provide all functional logic end-to-end.
- Prioritize local scoping and complete path resolution.
- Adhere to XDG Base Directory Specification for file paths where applicable.

## General Workflow

1. Ensure the repo is setup with the necessary rc files for the respective linters the project requires. **Review respective linter findings for all code in the codebase.**
2. For each issue, apply remediation according to standards detailed below.
3. Remove all merge artifact markers before proceeding.
4. Validate that all code now passes their respective linters with zero warnings or errors.
5. Assuming the repo is now validated and bug-free, proceed with the users specifications and tasks.
6. Ensure all variable assignments, quoting, and control structures are correct and robust.
7. For any remaining ambiguities or issues ensure to detail them in `0-tests/debrief.md`.
8. Comprehensively capture and detail all changes into `0-tests/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Minimal Testing Standards

**The following is based on a "**per-repo**" basis, meaning to apply the respective rule only if it is applicable to the project:**

  * Determine if the CI plan exists in the .github/workflows folder and create it if not.
  * Run `pnpm turbo run test --filter <project_name>` to run every check defined for that package.
  * From the package root you can just call `pnpm test`. The commit should pass all tests before you merge.
  * To focus on one step, add the Vitest pattern: `pnpm vitest run -t "<test name>"`.
  * Fix any test or type errors until the whole suite is green.
  * After moving files or changing imports, run `pnpm lint --filter <project_name>` to be sure ESLint and TypeScript rules still pass.
  * Add or update tests for the code you change, even if nobody asked.

**Development Environment Tips:**

  * Use `pnpm dlx turbo run where <project_name>` to jump to a package instead of scanning with `ls`.
  * Run `pnpm install --filter <project_name>` to add the package to your workspace so Vite, ESLint, and TypeScript can see it.
  * Use `pnpm create vite@latest <project_name> -- --template react-ts` to spin up a new React + Vite package with TypeScript checks ready.
  * Check the name field inside each package's package.json to confirm the right nameâ€”skip the top-level one.

## Success Criteria

### Validation
* Each function must be:

  * **Well-defined and fully implemented**.
  * **Idempotent** and **accessible**.
  * **Logically isolated** with explicit error capture.
  * **Appropriately declared and separated from assignments**.
  * **Free from ambiguity, newlines, extraneous input, or bad splitting**.
  * **Free of cyclomatic complexity**, using clear flow constructs
  * Properly quoted (expansions), especially in command arguments and redirections.
  * Free from short flags unless standard. (use long-form flags e.g., `--help`).
  * Non-interactive/pipeline-safe (e.g., `printf` over `echo`).
  * Explicitly error handling; check all critical command returns.
  * Checking for file existence/permissions and validating input/output and export.
  * Bounded appropriately with no arbitrary variables; they must be assigned.
  * XDG Specifications compliant.
  * Linted (no errors/warnings).
