# bash-resume.sh - Allows executing scripts with resume support. Will track what commands have completed, and (by default) exit on failure,
#  with subsequent runs skipping already-completed tasks.
#
#  See https://github.com/kata198/bash-resume
#
#   Look for example.sh for example usage, and use comments herein or README.md for documentation.
