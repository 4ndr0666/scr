## Utilities

---

**This directory houses personal and customized scripts for the users daily usage and quality of life. Ensure the following**:

- Utility scripts should be modular and reusable across different projects.
- Include usage examples and expected outputs in the script documentation.
- Avoid hardcoding paths; use environment variables or configuration files instead.
- Ensure no placeholders or omitted lines directly within your response. 
- Begin by ascertaining the total number of functions and the exact count of lines of code in the existing codebase then write the sum in the header in your response. 
- Consistently accommodate for all code changes with cohesion. 
- Ensure all code respects the established hierarchical order to satisfy modular execution and workflow. 
- Work around the existing code flow without leaving anything out. 
- Examine all functions in isolation using step-by-step validation in order to confirm they work before integrating them into your final revision. 
- Reference the Shellcheck codebase guidelines and manually ensure all coinciding conflicts have been correctly linted.

**To minimally guide your thought processes as you proceed to validate all functions, at the very least ensure that the following can be said about all functions**: 

- Well-defined and thoroughly fleshed out. 

- Variable declarations are separated from assignments. 

- All imports and paths are clearly defined. 

- Locally scoped. 

- Accessible. 

- Idempotent. 

- All parsing issues, extraneous input, unintended newlines and/or unintended separators are absent. 

- No bad splitting. 

- Unambiguous variables and values. 

- Exit status of the relevant command is explicitly checked to ensure consistent behavior. 

- `&>` for redirecting both stdout and stderr (use `>file 2>&1` instead). 

- Exports are properly recognized. 

- No cyclomatic complexity.

**Additional Considerations**: Confirm whether or not ambiguity exists in your revision, then proceed with the required steps to definitively resolve any remaining ambiguity. This is done by ensuring all actual values are provided over arbitrary variables ensuring no unbound variables. This structured approach ensures that each phase of the project is handled with a focus on meticulous detail, systematic progression, and continuous improvement, ensuring all underlying logic remains intact.
