üåü Overview

PermMaster is designed to manage and synchronize system permissions efficiently. One of its primary functionalities is to capture the factory (default) permissions and ownerships from a live ISO environment and apply them to an installed system. This ensures that the installed system maintains the same security and access configurations as the live environment, crucial for system integrity and security.

üîß Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
	1.	Live ISO Environment:
	‚Ä¢	A bootable Arch Linux live USB or DVD.
	‚Ä¢	Access to the terminal within the live environment.
	2.	Target Drive:
	‚Ä¢	A mounted drive where Arch Linux is installed.
	‚Ä¢	Sufficient storage space to accommodate the system files.
	3.	Root Privileges:
	‚Ä¢	Necessary permissions to execute system-level commands (sudo access).
	4.	Consistent Usernames and IDs:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that the usernames, user IDs (UID), and group IDs (GID) are consistent between the live environment and the installed system to prevent ownership mismatches.

üöÄ Step 1: Boot into the Live ISO Environment

	1.	Insert the Live USB/DVD:
	‚Ä¢	Plug in your Arch Linux live USB or insert the DVD into your computer.
	2.	Boot from the Live Media:
	‚Ä¢	Restart your computer.
	‚Ä¢	Access the BIOS/UEFI settings (commonly by pressing F2, F12, Del, or Esc during boot).
	‚Ä¢	Set the boot priority to boot from the USB/DVD.
	‚Ä¢	Save changes and exit to boot into the live environment.
	3.	Access the Terminal:
	‚Ä¢	Once booted, access the terminal by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T or by navigating through the desktop environment‚Äôs applications menu.

üîó Step 2: Mount the Target Drive

To apply permissions to the installed system, the target drive must be mounted.
	1.	Identify the Target Partition:
Use lsblk or fdisk to list all available drives and partitions.

lsblk

Sample Output:

NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk 
‚îú‚îÄsda1   8:1    0   500M  0 part /mnt/usb
‚îú‚îÄsda2   8:2    0 200.1G  0 part /
‚îú‚îÄsda3   8:3    0 730.4G  0 part /home
‚îî‚îÄsda4   8:4    0   1G  0 part [SWAP]

	‚Ä¢	Note: Replace /dev/sda2 and /dev/sda3 with your actual root and home partitions.

	2.	Create Mount Points:

sudo mkdir -p /mnt/target_root
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/target_home


	3.	Mount the Root Partition:

sudo mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/target_root


	4.	Mount the Home Partition (If Separate):

sudo mount /dev/sda3 /mnt/target_root/home

	‚Ä¢	Note: If your system does not have a separate home partition, skip this step.

	5.	Verify Mounts:

lsblk

	‚Ä¢	Ensure that /mnt/target_root (and /mnt/target_root/home if applicable) are correctly mounted.

üîÑ Step 3: Ensure Consistent User and Group IDs

To prevent ownership mismatches, it‚Äôs crucial that the UID and GID for users and groups are identical between the live environment and the installed system.

3.1. Check Current Users and Their IDs in Live Environment

	1.	List Users:

cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd


	2.	Check User IDs (UID):

awk -F: '{print $1, $3}' /etc/passwd

Sample Output:

root 0
user1 1000
user2 1001


	3.	Check Group IDs (GID):

awk -F: '{print $1, $3}' /etc/group

Sample Output:

root 0
users 100
wheel 10



3.2. Check Users and Their IDs in Installed System

	1.	Mount the Installed System‚Äôs /etc/passwd and /etc/group:

sudo cp /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd.backup
sudo cp /mnt/target_root/etc/group /mnt/target_root/etc/group.backup


	2.	View Users and IDs:

sudo cat /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1, $3}'

Sample Output:

root 0
user1 1000
user2 1001

sudo cat /mnt/target_root/etc/group | awk -F: '{print $1, $3}'

Sample Output:

root 0
users 100
wheel 10



3.3. Aligning User and Group IDs

If the UID and GID for users and groups are consistent between the live and installed systems, you can proceed. If not, follow these steps to align them.

3.3.1. Changing User IDs (UID) and Group IDs (GID)

‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Changing UID and GID can have significant implications, including loss of file ownership and access issues. Ensure you have backups and understand the changes you are making.
	1.	Backup Existing Files:

sudo cp /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd.bak
sudo cp /mnt/target_root/etc/group /mnt/target_root/etc/group.bak
sudo cp /mnt/target_root/etc/gshadow /mnt/target_root/etc/gshadow.bak
sudo cp /mnt/target_root/etc/shadow /mnt/target_root/etc/shadow.bak


	2.	Edit /etc/passwd:

sudo nano /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd

	‚Ä¢	Locate the user entries and modify the UID if necessary.
Example:
Change:

user1:x:1001:1001::/home/user1:/bin/bash

To:

user1:x:1000:1000::/home/user1:/bin/bash


	3.	Edit /etc/group:

sudo nano /mnt/target_root/etc/group

	‚Ä¢	Locate the group entries and modify the GID if necessary.
Example:
Change:

user1:x:1001:

To:

user1:x:1000:


	4.	Edit /etc/gshadow and /etc/shadow:
	‚Ä¢	These files contain secure group and user information and should be edited with care.

sudo nano /mnt/target_root/etc/gshadow
sudo nano /mnt/target_root/etc/shadow

	‚Ä¢	Ensure that the UID and GID changes are reflected appropriately.

	5.	Adjust File Ownerships on Target Drive:
After aligning the UID and GID, update the ownership of files to match the new IDs.

sudo chown -R user1:user1 /mnt/target_root/home/user1
sudo chown -R user2:user2 /mnt/target_root/home/user2


	6.	Verify Changes:

sudo cat /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd | grep user1
sudo cat /mnt/target_root/etc/group | grep user1

	‚Ä¢	Ensure that UID and GID are correctly updated.

3.3.2. Creating Missing Users or Groups

If a user or group exists in the live environment but not on the installed system (or vice versa), you need to create them to maintain consistency.
	1.	Identify Missing Users/Groups:
Compare the output of awk commands from both environments to identify discrepancies.
	2.	Create Missing Groups:

sudo groupadd -g <GID> <groupname>

Example:

sudo groupadd -g 1001 user1


	3.	Create Missing Users:

sudo useradd -u <UID> -g <GID> -m -s /bin/bash <username>

Example:

sudo useradd -u 1001 -g 1001 -m -s /bin/bash user1


	4.	Set User Passwords:

sudo passwd <username>

Example:

sudo passwd user1


	5.	Verify Creation:

sudo cat /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd | grep user1
sudo cat /mnt/target_root/etc/group | grep user1

üìÅ Step 4: Use rsync to Sync Permissions and Ownerships

With user and group IDs aligned, proceed to synchronize the system files from the live environment to the installed system using rsync.

4.1. Prepare the rsync Command

Comprehensive rsync Command:

sudo rsync -aAXv --delete --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} / /mnt/target_root

Explanation of Options:
	‚Ä¢	sudo: Ensures rsync has the necessary permissions to read and write all files.
	‚Ä¢	rsync: The command itself.
	‚Ä¢	-a: Archive mode; equals -rlptgoD:
	‚Ä¢	-r: Recursive
	‚Ä¢	-l: Copy symlinks as symlinks
	‚Ä¢	-p: Preserve permissions
	‚Ä¢	-t: Preserve modification times
	‚Ä¢	-g: Preserve group
	‚Ä¢	-o: Preserve owner
	‚Ä¢	-D: Preserve device and special files
	‚Ä¢	-A: Preserves ACLs (Access Control Lists).
	‚Ä¢	-X: Preserves extended attributes.
	‚Ä¢	-v: Verbose; provides detailed output of the synchronization process.
	‚Ä¢	--delete: Deletes files in the destination that are not present in the source, ensuring an exact mirror.
	‚Ä¢	--exclude={...}: Excludes specific directories that should not be copied:
	‚Ä¢	/dev/*: Device files
	‚Ä¢	/proc/*: Process information
	‚Ä¢	/sys/*: System information
	‚Ä¢	/tmp/*: Temporary files
	‚Ä¢	/run/*: Runtime data
	‚Ä¢	/mnt/* and /media/*: Mount points
	‚Ä¢	/lost+found: Recovered files
	‚Ä¢	/: Source directory, representing the root of the live environment.
	‚Ä¢	/mnt/target_root: Destination directory, representing the mount point of the target drive.

4.2. Execute the rsync Command

	1.	Run the Command:

sudo rsync -aAXv --delete --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} / /mnt/target_root


	2.	Monitor the Process:
	‚Ä¢	The -v flag will display detailed information about the files being copied.
	‚Ä¢	Progress Indicators: For very large directories, consider adding the --progress flag to monitor the progress of individual files.
Enhanced Command with Progress:

sudo rsync -aAXv --progress --delete --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} / /mnt/target_root


	3.	Estimated Time:
	‚Ä¢	The synchronization time depends on the size of the source directory and the speed of your storage devices.
	‚Ä¢	Tip: Be patient and avoid interrupting the process to prevent incomplete synchronization.
	4.	Completion Message:
	‚Ä¢	Upon successful completion, rsync will provide a summary of the transfer, including the total number of files transferred, total bytes, and the transfer speed.

üîç Step 5: Verify the Synchronization

After running rsync, it‚Äôs essential to verify that the permissions and ownerships have been correctly applied to the target system.

5.1. Basic Verification

	1.	Check Ownership and Permissions of Critical Files:

ls -l /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd
ls -l /mnt/target_root/etc/shadow
ls -l /mnt/target_root/etc/group
ls -l /mnt/target_root/etc/gshadow

Expected Output:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  2345 Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow  1234 Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/etc/shadow
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  3456 Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/etc/group
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow  7890 Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/etc/gshadow


	2.	Verify User Directories:

ls -ld /mnt/target_root/home/user1
ls -ld /mnt/target_root/home/user2

Expected Output:

drwxr-xr-x 20 user1 user1 4096 Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/home/user1
drwxr-xr-x 15 user2 user2 4096 Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/home/user2


	3.	Check Permissions of Executable Files:

ls -l /mnt/target_root/bin/bash
ls -l /mnt/target_root/usr/bin/mpv

Expected Output:

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  103K Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1.2M Nov 27 10:00 /mnt/target_root/usr/bin/mpv



5.2. Detailed Verification with diff

For a more thorough comparison, you can use diff to identify differences between the source and target directories. However, be cautious as this can be resource-intensive for large directories.
	1.	Run diff Command:

sudo diff -r / /mnt/target_root

Explanation:
	‚Ä¢	-r: Recursively compare subdirectories.
	‚Ä¢	/: Source directory.
	‚Ä¢	/mnt/target_root: Destination directory.

	2.	Interpreting Results:
	‚Ä¢	No Output: Indicates that there are no differences between the source and target directories.
	‚Ä¢	Differences Listed: Review and address any discrepancies as needed.

5.3. Verify ACLs and Extended Attributes

	1.	Check ACLs:

sudo getfacl /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd
sudo getfacl /mnt/target_root/home/user1/.bashrc

Expected Output:
	‚Ä¢	ACL entries should match those from the live environment.

	2.	Check Extended Attributes:

sudo getfattr -d /mnt/target_root/etc/passwd
sudo getfattr -d /mnt/target_root/home/user1/.bashrc

Expected Output:
	‚Ä¢	Extended attributes should be preserved and match the source.

‚úÖ Step 6: Finalize the Setup

After successfully synchronizing permissions and ownerships, perform the following steps to ensure the installed system operates correctly.

6.1. Update Bootloader (If Necessary)

If you cloned the entire root filesystem, you might need to reinstall or update the bootloader to ensure the system boots correctly.
	1.	Chroot into the Installed System:

sudo arch-chroot /mnt/target_root


	2.	Reinstall GRUB (Example for BIOS Systems):

grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sda
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

	‚Ä¢	Note: Replace /dev/sda with the appropriate drive identifier.

	3.	Exit Chroot:

exit



6.2. Update fstab (If Necessary)

Ensure that the /etc/fstab file on the target system reflects the correct UUIDs and mount points.
	1.	Generate New fstab:

sudo genfstab -U /mnt/target_root >> /mnt/target_root/etc/fstab


	2.	Verify fstab:

sudo nano /mnt/target_root/etc/fstab

	‚Ä¢	Ensure that all entries are correct and point to the right UUIDs and mount points.

6.3. Unmount the Target Drive

After all changes are applied, safely unmount the target drive.
	1.	Unmount All Partitions:

sudo umount -R /mnt/target_root


	2.	Safely Remove Live Media:
	‚Ä¢	Remove the live USB/DVD to prevent booting back into the live environment.

üõ†Ô∏è Additional Considerations

	1.	Preserve Symlinks and Special Files:
	‚Ä¢	The -aAX flags in rsync ensure that symlinks, device files, and special files are preserved correctly.
	2.	Handle Bind Mounts (If Any):
	‚Ä¢	If your system uses bind mounts (e.g., /proc, /sys), ensure they are excluded during synchronization to prevent inconsistencies.
	3.	SELinux or AppArmor Contexts:
	‚Ä¢	If your system uses security modules like SELinux or AppArmor, ensure that context attributes are preserved and updated accordingly.
	4.	Service Files and Systemd:
	‚Ä¢	After synchronization, verify that systemd services and other critical services are functioning correctly. Restart services if necessary.
	5.	Disk Space:
	‚Ä¢	Ensure that the target drive has sufficient disk space to accommodate all files from the live environment.
	6.	Network Configuration:
	‚Ä¢	If network configurations differ between the live environment and the installed system, adjust /etc/hostname, /etc/hosts, and network manager configurations accordingly.
