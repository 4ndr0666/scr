Implemented enhancements for prompt_builder suite:
- Defined camera movement tags via promptlib in sora_prompt_builder.sh.
- Corrected PYTHONPATH export per ShellCheck guidance.
- Updated plugin_loader.py to open files using context managers.
- Added unit tests covering plugin parsing and Deakins lighting logic.
All tests pass.

Clipboard copy is now default in sora_prompt_builder.sh and the README was updated accordingly.
