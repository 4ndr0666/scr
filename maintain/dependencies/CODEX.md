# Deps and Deps-beta Comparative Analysis

## 1. Role & Scope

You are required to analyze the deps and deps-beta codes in this dir. Your tasks will include:
- Analyzing code, grading the code, refactoring, debugging and merging.
- Generating a comprehensive feature‑to‑function matrix across all codebases. 
- Spotting which capabilities are missing in each codebase.
- Ascertain the best implementation of all overlapping functions.
- Rework a unified and superior function/implementation.
- Consider the following:
  1. Does the prompt meet its intended purpose?
  2. How could the prompt be improved based on coding best practices?
  3. How does it compare to industry standards in terms of maintainability, performance, and usability?"

## 2 Environment, Idempotency & Error Handling  

- Always reference user configuration via XDG variables (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, `$XDG_DATA_HOME`, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME`).
- Do **not** hard‑code absolute paths in scripts; assume environment variables are set at invocation.
- Ensuring idempotency, modularity and portability across unix-like systems.
- Every function must validate inputs (`[ $# -ge … ]`, `[ -d … ]`, etc.) and fail gracefully with a usage message or error code.
- Use `trap '…' EXIT` for cleanup of any temporary resources.
- Avoid side effects when preconditions are not met.

## 3. Example Invocation

When asked to perform a comparative analysis on two scripts:

1. **Perform individual Code Analysis and Summary:**     
   - **deps:** Sum total function count and take the total line count for the script in preparation for comparision with deps-beta.   
   - **deps-beta:** Repeat the same and compare it with deps in order to identify all gaps and overlaps between both iterations.

2. **Example Table For Sorting Overlapping and Missing Functions:**  
```
# | Function Name | Task Description | Deps | Deps-beta | Status
1 | register_temp_file | Record a temp file path for later cleanup. | Append to TEMP_FILES array | Same—POSIX $XDG_CACHE_HOME for temp storage if desired | Pending
2 | register_temp_dir | Record a temp directory path for later cleanup. | Append to TEMP_DIRS array | Same—ensure use of mktemp --tmpdir="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR" | Pending
3 | cleanup_all | Remove all registered temp files and directories on exit or signal. | rm -f/rm -rf in trap | Same—add check for $TMPDIR and respect XDG_RUNTIME_DIR | Pending
4 | verbose_log | Print a [VERBOSE] message if -v is enabled. | Simple echo "[VERBOSE]" | Same—prefix output with timestamp (e.g. date +%T) when verbose | Pending
5 | error_exit | Print an error to stderr and exit with status 1. | echo >&2; exit 1 | Same—centralize error codes in a lookup table for clarity | Pending
```

3. **Answer the following prompt to yourself in order to craft the framework for optimization:**
> "If you were to rewrite the prompt with the same goals in mind, how would you approach the problem? What changes would you make in terms of structure, design, or logic to improve performance, scalability, and maintainability?"
